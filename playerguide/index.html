   <h1>Why you should find an online game</h1>
   <p>
      If you don't have five friends who can meet up in a basement twice a week to play D&D for eight hours, don't let that
      stop you! Telling yourself you need the "perfect" group is just stealing precious game sessions from your life. I
      love in-person games, but commuting sucks. Online games are easier to get to, and you can assemble a group that
      sticks around. If you don't know where to look for open tables, check the list of sites on brothersgm.com.
      <br><br>
      Find a time slot and duration YOU can stick to. Most online games run 2–4 hours; I recommend trying shorter games if
      you're new. If you don't know what you prefer, play in a one-shot! There's no commitment. Try out a GM, other
      players, or a ruleset you aren't familiar with. Worst case, you learn some red flags for the future, and the session
      naturally ends. If you find one other person at the table you like, message them: "Hey! Great session tonight, I'm
      still looking for a longer-term game. Let me know if you join a table with empty seats." This tells them you'd like
      to play together, but gives them an easy out. No one likes to feel socially pressured.
      <br><br>
      If you luck into a great group, stick with them! As your session winds down, ask: "What are we all doing this time
      next week?" Tell the table you'd love to play more. Don't just assume someone else will say it—you say it. You
      already know you were all able to play at a given time. If you form a pod of 3–4 players, you can just go shopping
      for a GM. Think of it like players grouping up for videogames.
      <br><br>
      And hey—DnD Beyond, Roll20, Foundry, they all cost your GM money. Unless you're on a free tier (which is designed to
      burn a GM's prep time), there's also rulebooks, maps, music… So especially if you're in a free game, show up, be on
      time, and remember the GM is a player at the table too.
   </p>
   <h1>How to find your online game</h1>
   <p>
      If you are willing to invest the time, free tables do exist. Paid games are a shortcut, with a much higher likelyhood
      of a consistenty
   
      If you are lucky enough to find a great group, stick with them! As your campaign winds down, talk to the group
      directly about "what do we want to do next?" and tell the GM clearly that you want them to run this group through
      another campaign. Do not take it as given!
   
      One thing players can do to help is organize here on Reddit or Discord or wherever, but outside of game sessions. If
      you played a one-shot and really liked one of the other players, connect with them. Find something you both want to
      play and join together. Many people already do this, it's better than going solo. At least one other person at the
      table will vibe with you. Form a group of 3-4 and you can just shop for a GM and not worry about finding good players
      too.
   <h2>
      Try a one-shot!
   </h2>
   
   Low investment, free or $15 one-shot scheduled for only 2 hours?
   
   - Pre-gen characters
   - simple 'in media res' plot? Just enough to get a feel for the DM and table vibe?
   
   
   Note that DnD beyond, Roll20, and Foundry all cost your GM money (unless you're using the most barebones free tiers).
   There are also the rulebooks, unlocking paid content to use etc...
   So especially if you're in a free game, show up, show up on time, and appreciate that they're a player at the table
   as well.

   <h1>How to be the best player</h1>
   <p>
      Be the Scully to their Mulder. There's a reason that show ran for so many seasons! That is a compelling dynamic.
      Consider how it works as well: Scully scolds and doubts, but never so much the audience gets annoyed at her stopping
      the plot from happening. Don't STOP the fun stuff from happening, just pause for a moment before it happens like a
      normal person would.
   
   <h3>
      Be Good at Your Role
   </h3>
   Take inspiration from Scully in The X-Files: she's a competent member of the team, skilled at her job, and able to step
   up when needed. Whatever character you play, make sure you know the basics of what they do and how to help the group
   succeed. Whether you're the classic cleric, a lockpicker, or a simple bruiser, understanding your character's strengths
   and the rules that apply to them isn't "meta-gaming"—it's just being a good teammate.
   
   <h3>
      Helping Other Players
   </h3>
   There's a common problem in tabletop games called "quarterbacking," where one player tells others how to play their
   characters. This can take away from everyone's enjoyment. The goal isn't for everyone to play optimally, but for
   everyone to have fun and contribute in their own way. Instead of giving out-of-character instructions, try supporting
   your fellow players in character. Compliment their character's skills or ask them questions that let them shine. For
   example: "Hey, didn't you used to be a city guard? Would you know anything about this?" or "Your teleportation magic is
   so cool! I wonder if it would help here?"
   
   <h2>
      You've Heard of "Yes, And..."—What About "Indeed"?
   </h2>
   Teal'c from Stargate is a great example of a supporting character who adds a lot to the group dynamic, even with few
   words. If you're shy or new to roleplaying, having a character with a simple, consistent way of responding—like Teal'c's
   "Indeed"—can be a feature, not a bug. Support your party members' ideas, or voice your concerns in character ("That
   would be unwise.").
   
   If you're playing a non-human, consider arranging some culture-shock moments with your GM. These can overlap with the
   quirks of other party members and help reinforce that your setting is unique. For example, in the Stormlight Archive,
   women are expected to keep their left hand covered—a small detail that constantly reminds readers the world isn't Earth.
   Don't worry about having "space Catholics," "space anime land," or "Scottish-accented dwarves"—these shortcuts can help
   everyone quickly understand the setting and have fun.
   
   And remember, perfect cultural sensitivity isn't the goal at your home game table. Just like people at a farmers market
   are already doing great by not shopping at a big box store, your group is already doing something special by playing
   together.
