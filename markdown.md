# Determining Difficulty Levels
**Regular difficulty level**: Opposing skill/characteristic is below 50, or the task is a standard one. Roll equal to or below full value to succeed.
**Hard difficulty level**: Opposing skill/characteristic is equal to or above 50, or the task is very difficult. Roll equal to or below half value to succeed.
**Extreme difficulty level**: Opposing skill/characteristic is equal to or above 90, or this task is on the borders of human capability. Roll equal to or below fifth value to succeed.

# Comparing Results
**(worst) FUMBLE - FAIL - REGULAR SUCCESS - HARD SUCCESS - EXTREME SUCCESS - CRITICAL (best)**.
If a tie: side with the higher skill or characteristic wins.
**Pushing the Roll**: A second and final attempt to achieve a goal, only allowed if justified by player. If failed, Keeper may bring dire consequences.
**Opposed rolls**: Best level of success wins (opposed rolls cannot be pushed).

# Critical Fumble
**(skill > 50%) “01”**.

# Fumble
**(skill < 50%) “100” “96—100” (Firearms)**.

# Bouts of Madness - Summary
Pick or roll 1D10.
1. **Amnesia**: Investigator comes to their senses in unfamiliar place with no memory of who they are. Memories return slowly over time.
2. **Robbed**: Investigator comes to their senses 1D10 hours later, having been robbed. They are unharmed. If they were carrying a Treasured Possession, make a Luck roll to see if it was stolen. Everything else of value is automatically missing.
3. **Battered**: Investigator comes to their senses 1D10 hours later to find themselves battered and bruised. HP reduced to half of what they were before going insane (does not cause a major wound). They have not been robbed.
4. **Violence**: Investigator explodes in a spree of violence and destruction. When the investigator comes to their senses, their actions may or may not be apparent or remembered.
5. **Ideology/Beliefs**: Review the investigator’s backstory entry for Ideology and Beliefs. The investigator manifests one of these in an extreme manner.
6. **Significant People**: Consult the investigator’s backstory entry for Significant People and why the relationship is so important. In the time that passes (1D10 hours or more) the investigator has done their best to travel to that person and act upon their relationship in some way.
7. **Institutionalized**: Investigator comes to their senses in a psychiatric ward or police cell.
8. **Flee in panic**: When the investigator comes to their senses they are far away, perhaps lost in the wilderness or on a train or long-distance bus.
9. **Phobia**: Investigator gains a new phobia; investigator comes to their senses 1D10 hours later, having taken every precaution to avoid their new phobia.
10. **Mania**: Investigator gains a new mania; investigator comes to their senses 1D10 hours later. During this bout of madness, the investigator will have been fully indulging in their new mania.

# Other Forms of Damage - Injury Damage Examples
**Minor**: a person could survive numerous occurrences of this level of damage.
* 1D3 Punch, kick, head-butt, mild acid, breathing smoky atmosphere*, a thrown fist-size rock, falling (per 10 feet) on to soft swamp.
**Moderate**: might cause a major wound; it would take a few such attacks to kill.
* 1D6 Falling (per 10 feet) on to grass, club, strong acid, breathing water*, exposure to vacuum*, small caliber bullet, arrow, fire (burning torch).
**Severe**: likely to cause a major wound. One or two occurrences would render a person unconscious or dead.
* 1D10 .38 caliber bullet, falling (per 10 feet) on to concrete, axe, fire (flamethrower, running through a burning room), being 6 to 9 yards from an exploding hand grenade or stick of dynamite, a mild poison**.
**Deadly**: the average person has a 50% chance of dying.
* 2D10 Hit by a car at 30mph, being 3 to 6 yards from an exploding hand grenade or stick of dynamite, a strong poison**.
**Terminal**: outright death is likely.
* 4D10 Hit by a speeding car, being within 3 yards of an exploding hand grenade or stick of dynamite, a lethal poison**.
**Splat**: outright death almost certain.
* 8D10 Being involved in a high-speed head-on collision, being hit by a train.
*Asphyxiation and drowning: Make CON roll each round; once CON roll is failed, damage is sustained each round thereafter until death or victim is able to breathe. If in a state of physical exertion, a Hard success is required on the CON roll. Death occurs at 0 hit points (ignore Major Wound rule).
**Poisons**: A roll equal to or less than one-fifth of CON will halve damage from poisons.

# Combat - Establish the Order of Attack
Rank in DEX order: Highest goes first.

# Investigator Development Phase
* Roll 1D100 for each skill checked. If the result is higher than the skill or over 95, add 1D10 skill points.
* Erase checks.
* If an increase raises a skill to 90% or more, add 2D6 Sanity points.
* Check Credit Rating and review finances (see Employment and Credit Rating, page 96).
* Seek to recover Sanity (see Increasing Current Sanity Points, page 167).
* Review the investigator’s background (see Altering an Investigator’s Background, page 95).

# Bonus and Penalty Dice
**Bonus die**: Roll additional ‘tens’ die alongside the usual pair of percentage dice. Use the ‘tens’ dice that yields the better (lowest) result.
**Penalty die**: Roll additional ‘tens’ die alongside the usual pair of percentage dice. Use the ‘tens’ dice that yields the worse (highest) result.

# Spells & Tomes
Initial Reading, page 173. Full Study, page 174. Mythos Rating, page 175. Learning a Spell, page 176. Casting a Spell, page 177.

# Human Limits & Assisting
**100 + skill is the upper limit of what can be opposed**.
For each PC assisting, deduct their skill value from opposing value (starting lowest first).
Continue until the opposing value can be challenged by a single PC (opposition cannot be reduced to zero).
Any PCs who did not contribute their skill values may make skill roll vs. opposing skill/value.

# Combat - Extreme Level of Success?
(N/A if Defender is Fighting Back).
**Impale**: Max damage + max DB + roll weapon damage.
**Blunt**: Max damage + max DB.

# Combat - Outnumbered?
Once a character has Dodged or Fought Back in a round, all subsequent attacks on them receive **1 Bonus die**. Does not apply for those with multiple attacks (who may Dodge/Fight Back as many times as they have attacks before the Outnumbered rule applies).

# Combat - Maneuver
**Compare Builds**: If initiator is smaller = **1 Penalty die** for each point difference. If difference is 3+ = Maneuver is impossible.

# Combat - Fight Back
Highest level of success wins. Draw = Initiator wins. Both fail = No damage inflicted.

# Combat - Dodge
Attacker wins with higher level of success. Draw = Defender wins. Both fail = No damage inflicted.

# Combat - Maneuver (Resolution)
Resolve as for Fight Back, but instead of inflicting damage apply the effect of maneuver.

# Combat Rolls
**Combat rolls cannot be Pushed**.

# Combat - Resolve in DEX order
a) Initiate Attack, Flee, or Maneuver.
b) Defender chooses to Dodge, Fight Back, or perform Maneuver.
c) Attacker & defender make opposed roll.

# Hit Points fall to zero
Write ‘D’ in current hit points if a major wound has been taken.

# Healing - Natural
+1 HP per day.

# Healing - First Aid
+1 HP. Temporarily stabilised (+1 hit point) if administered successfully when dying.

# Healing - Medicine
+1D3 HP. If administered successfully within the next hour after falling unconscious and dying, CON roll at end of every hour.

# Healing - Dying
CON roll at end of the round after falling unconscious and every round thereafter; failure means death. If First Aid is successful, temporarily stabilised (+1 hit point). Within the next hour, if Medicine is successful, CON roll at end of every hour. If CON roll is passed, healing begins: Uncheck “dying” box and gain +1D3 HP. Make a Major Wound Recovery roll at the end of each week.

# Major Wound Healing
Make a CON roll at the end of each week.
* **Fail**: No healing.
* **Success**: Heal 1D3 points.
* **Extreme Success**: Heal 2D3 points and erase Major Wound. Bonus die if well cared-for (Medicine roll). Bonus die if patient is resting/good environment. Penalty die if conditions are poor.

# Vehicle Damage
**Build reduced to half of its starting value or lower = Impaired**: 1 penalty die applied to all Drive Auto (or appropriate skill) rolls.
**Damage equal to full Build value in one incident = Wrecked**: Rolls/burns/etc. – Keeper determines outcome (e.g. 2D10 damage to occupants; Luck rolls to survive, etc.).
**Build reduced to zero by cumulative damage = Undrivable**: Grinds to a halt – Keeper determines outcome (e.g. 1D10 damage to occupants; Luck rolls to reduce damage, etc.).

# Damage Levels
If the damage from a single attack is:
* **Less than half the character’s maximum hit points = Regular Damage**.
* **Equal to or more than half the character’s maximum hit points = Major Wound**.
* **More than the character’s maximum hit points = Death**.
